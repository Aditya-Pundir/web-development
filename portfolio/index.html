        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="aboutMe">
            Hi there, myself Aditya Pundir, I am a full stack web developer as well as an android developer. I started learning code when I was 11 years old and as of now I am 13 years old on 12 March 2021. I started to code in a young age because I am like how the things are made. One day I was playing a mobile game and a thought suddenly came into my mind that how is this game made and who makes these apps and games. Then I discussed this with my elder brother and sister and they told me that it is done by programming and programmers are the persons who make all the softwares. So then I decided to make an app and got into the feild of programming.
